Wu wei

Wu wei is a very ancient chinese term with several significances; them very related in my opinion.

"Do nothing", "non-action", "let it be" and I've also read it refers to "growth"; and the correspondence between the macro and the micro, the balance between opposites, and some more.

For some while I very much related computer sciences with this kind of philosophies, at its basics: 
the "binary" system, the "Boolean" logic.  Build everything upon only two types of blocks: positives or negatives.
To do or not to do. The infinte or the nothing. Male or female. Life and death? +5v/-5v? Electrons or protons.
I could go on, and also could you: it's all over across the universe, time, things and ideas and things that arent things nor ideas.

Ok then, what the %"$# is this?

This is just a "work of art" library that implements some Wu wei philosophy (?!) like functional programming (Google(tm) that!) 
for boolean operations, it also features a conditional callback executer.
It provides a funny and functional way to use "and", "or", "if" without actually using any of them.
(ok I admit it, there is a "||" operator because I needed not a boolean return from it)

I try to use the very basics and primitive boolean operations and the basic boolean operators provided by JavaScript.
Also using typecasting from bool to int and vice versa.
I think most of this could be easily ported to any other language, excepting for: 
* Function.apply
* Array.slice
* Array.shift
* Array.concat

All of them I think would be very easy to implement in other languages. 
 
I also try to be as low level and declarative as possible, doing everything through functions and... noop-functions

Some of it is kind of inspired by _ (Underscore.js / LoDash.js) 
Whome, by the way, provides much more useful tools "_.every" and "_.some", that

    “…Vida y muerte son abstracciones del crecimiento,
    dificultad y facilidad son abstracciones del progreso,
    cerca y lejos son abstracciones de la posición,
    fuerza y debilidad son abstracciones del control,
    música y habla son abstracciones de la armonía,
    antes y después son abstracciones de la secuencia...”  Tao Te Ching.
